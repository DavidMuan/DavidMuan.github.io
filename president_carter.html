    <p>Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, was born in 1924 in Georgia. He spent his childhood laboring on the family peanut farm. After high school, he entered the U.S. Naval Academy - served in the Navy as a submarine officer. When his father died, Carter went back to Georgia and took over the farm - he moved into politics and won the Georgia governorship in 1971 pushing civil rights measures plus streamlining state agencies. 
        Voters chose him president in 1976. His term produced the Camp David Accords that ended conflict between Egypt but also Israel, but it also saw double digit inflation. The Iran hostage crisis dominated his final year and he failed to win a second term in 1980. He left Washington and turned to humanitarian projects. Through the Carter Center, he monitored elections, mediated disputes along with led campaigns that reduced Guinea worm disease. The Nobel Committee awarded him the Peace Prize in 2002.
