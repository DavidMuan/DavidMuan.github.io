    <p>Franklin D. The 32nd President of the United States, was born in Hyde Park, New York, on January 30, 1882. He studied at Harvard University and then at Columbia Law School. Roosevelt entered public service first as a state senator and later served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy.
        In 1921, he contracted polio - the disease left him unable to walk without support yet he pursued recovery plus rebuilt his political career. The voters of New York elected him governor in 1928 and his management of the Great Depression drew nationwide attention. In 1932 he won the presidency and served four terms, the only U.S. president to hold office that long. His New Deal programs reorganized the American economy but also delivered help to millions during the Depression. He also guided the nation through most of World War II, built strong alliances and set plans for the United Nations. Roosevelt died in office on April 12, 1945 along with historians rank him among the most influential leaders in American history.
